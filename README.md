# Train a Smartcab How to Drive

Reinforcement Learning Project

## Install

This project requires Python 2.7 with the pygame library installed:

https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

## Code

Open `agent.py` and implement `LearningAgent`.

## Run

Make sure you are in the top-level project directory containing the four python files as 
well as the images folder, then run:

```python agent.py```

OR:

```python -m agent```

LearningAgent is the only file you need to run to run this program, all other files are
helper files that don't necessarily need to be adjusted at all. You may make changes in 
any files you like but the file you should be most concerned with is just the learning
agent file. This file is where the program really is adjustable from.
